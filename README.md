transport in Kigali Rwanda. On occasions like Wedding, Vacation, house shifting, and tour outside Kigali and on many other situations they feel the necessity of a vehicle to sort out the
problems. So if it is possible to design or develop a web based application for availing
transport whenever and wherever possible, then it will be beneficial for both renter and
transport provider. Now a days, by some clicks only, we can get whatever you want at home.
